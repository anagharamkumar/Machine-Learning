# Machine-Learning
This is a supervised machine learning regression algorithm to predict the marks a students will get based on the number of hours he studied
Following are the steps involved:
  Read the dataset,
  Plot a scatter plot to see the correlation between hours studied and marks obtained,
  Split the data into train and test,
  Build a linear regression model and train the model,
  Test the model using a new data point,
  Evaluate the model
